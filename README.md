# EscapeVerse
Our platform gamifies learning with an Escape Room Challenge, where users solve subject-based puzzles to progress. A personalized roadmap, leaderboard, and AI support keep learning interactive and engaging

## Overview
The traditional learning experience often lacks personalization and engagement, making it difficult for students to stay motivated and track their strengths and weaknesses. Our project, the AI-Powered Adaptive Learning Escape Room, aims to revolutionize education by combining interactive quizzes, machine learning-based assessments, and a gamified escape room experience.

## The Problem
Lack of Personalization: Students struggle with fixed learning paths that don’t cater to their individual strengths and weaknesses.  
Low Engagement in Learning: Many learners find conventional learning methods boring, reducing retention rates.  
Difficulty in Skill Assessment: Traditional tests fail to provide real-time feedback on a learner’s specific weaknesses and strengths.  

## Solution
Our AI Escape Room offers:  
✅ Quiz-Based Skill Assessment: Learners take an adaptive quiz, and ML (scikit-learn) analyzes their answers to determine their strengths and weaknesses.  
✅ Personalized Study Plan: AI recommends tailored learning resources based on quiz performance.  
✅ Gamified Learning: Users progress through an escape room challenge where they must solve subject-based questions to advance.  
✅ Leaderboard & Performance Tracking: Users see their progress, compare scores, and receive personalized feedback.  

## Technologies Used:
